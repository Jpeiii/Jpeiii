## HELLO WORLD, JIN PEI HERE!ðŸ˜Š

A tech enthusiast who loves getting hands-on with building things. By day, Iâ€™m a senior software developer, and by night (or whenever I get a chance). 
Iâ€™m deep-diving into the world of AI, especially LLMs and CNNs. Iâ€™ve been working with AI/DL long before the LLM boom, back when it wasnâ€™t the cool kid on the block.
Basically, my whole career has been about wrangling AI in one way or another.  

Currently, Iâ€™m also a teaching assistant at NUS because, honestly, what better way to learn than by teaching?
On the side, I enjoy building stuff with whatever skills I have, always experimenting with new ideas.  

Iâ€™m also practicing to be a speaker, so if thereâ€™s a topic that aligns with my expertise, Iâ€™d be happy to give a talk. 

Always open for a coffee chat, whether itâ€™s about AI, startups, or just the hustle of building something from scratch!
Oops, but with AI in the mix, I guess Iâ€™m more like vibe coding, vibe writing, vibe strategizing... 
basically just vibing my way through everything, not really starting from scratch anymore! ðŸ˜†
